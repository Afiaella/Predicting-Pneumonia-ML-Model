## Introduction
Pneumonia is a disease, usually caused by an infection, that affects the lungs and it is usually diagnosed by physicians using radiological imaging to determine the infectious agent that causes the disease. 15% of child deaths were caused by Pneumonia in 2017 making it the leading cause of death in children under 5yrs old.

Again you can see that the death rate from pneumonia is highest in  Africa and Asia. A clear difference between richer and poorer countries.

Below is an example of chest X rays, and the kind of chest X rays that our model is going to analyse. The first one is a normal chest X rays and the other three are  examples of chest x-rays with different types of Pneumonia. Differentiating X-rays with Pneumonia and X-rays without, could be difficult, as you can see by looking at image 1 and 4.

Armed with this information and knowing that pneumonia cannot easily be detected with the human eye, we set out to develop a convoluted neural network (CNN) model that  can analyse chest x-ray image and determine whether a person has pneumonia or not.

At the end of this presentation, we hope that our model will be used in the healthcare industry to improve detection of pneumonia and ultimately reduce mortality rate especially in under 5 children.
